Men and Gentleladies, it's done ! You can use this wonderful little script to create your very own Devourer of Gods as a Beatblock tag !
Here's how it works; you'll need to download the file an run it in any program that supports python and it's Turtle module
Running it will create an empty window. Ignore it until it says 'simulation displayed'
Answer every input (and don't put incoherent answers, this program is all but foolproof)
Afterwards, you will get a simulation on the previously empty window
This simulation will have the base Beatblock screen as well as the Devourer of God's start location in red and end location in green
Type in 'y' to create the tag
The tag will be created next to wherever you've put the python script; because of this, you can just put the script in the tag folder in Beatblock
And presto ! it's a working Devourer of Gods. Hopefully, at least.
